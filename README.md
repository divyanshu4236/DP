# DP

This is the Java solution for the minimum steps problem using the concept of Dynamic Programming whose problem statement is as follows:

Given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of steps s, that takes n to 1. You can perform any one of the following 3 steps.
1.) Subtract 1 from it. (n= n - 1) ,
2.) If its divisible by 2, divide by 2.( if n%2==0, then n= n/2 ) ,
3.) If its divisible by 3, divide by 3. (if n%3 == 0, then n = n / 3 ). 
The time complexity of your code should be O(n).
